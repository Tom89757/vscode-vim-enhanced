# vscode-vim-enhanced

Please forgive my poor English ðŸ˜€.
**vscode-vim-enhanced** is an enhanced extension for the VSCode Vim plugin, designed to:

1. Provide highlighting for Visual Studio Code's Vim plugin `find` and `sneak` operations to improve editing efficiency. This plugin does not affect the functionality of `find` and `sneak`, it only highlights characters.
2. Display relative line numbers when entering Visual Line and Visual Block modes to facilitate multi-line selection.

**Before installing this plugin, install Vim-api (a slightly modified version of the official Vim, which includes certain APIs necessary for this plugin).**

This plugin was inspired by [magdyamr542/vim-find-highlight: Quickly go to words with vim f command (VSCode extension)](https://github.com/magdyamr542/vim-find-highlight) and improved upon it.

**Find Operation Illustration:** Red indicates that pressing the character will directly jump to the corresponding position; green indicates that pressing the character will not directly jump to that position (multiple jumps are needed).

**Sneak Operation Illustration:** Red indicates that pressing the character will directly jump to the corresponding position; green indicates that pressing the character will not directly jump to that position (multiple jumps are needed).
